1. Write a program to print all the lines in a file that have even number of characthers.

    if(len(line)%2==0):
        print(line)
file_Handle.close()




2. Write a program to print all the lines ina file prefixed with line numbers. 

file_Handle = open("auth.log","r")
i=1
for line in file_Handle:
    print(f"{i}. {line}")
    i=i+1
file_Handle.close()







3. Modify the above program to write the lines with line numbers to a new file. 
file_Handle1= open("auth.log","r")
file_Handle2=open("Newtextdoc.txt","w")
i=1
for line in file_Handle1:
    file_Handle2.write(f"{i}. {line}")
    i=i+1
file_Handle2.close()
file_Handle1.close()



4. Write a program to print all the lines in a file that have the word "The" in it. 
file_Handle = open("auth.log","r")
for line in file_Handle:
    if "The" in line:
        print(line)
file_Handle.close()



5. Write a program to search for user given string in a file, and print line and line number that has the string. 

np = input("Enter a string: ")
file_Handle = open("Newtextdoc.txt","r")
i=1
for line in file_Handle:
    if(inp in line):
        print(f"{line}")
    i=i+1
    
        
file_Handle.close()

6. Write a program to print a specfic line number as requested by the user. 
7. Write a program to print a range of lines with line number  requested by the user.

with key as the line number and the value as the line.
